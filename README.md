# Tic-tac-toe made with Reach framework

- This is an app I made during the Road to Hire program

- We used many hooks to build this app to use this project as a project based learning experience

## Downloading the app

Clone or download the repository onto your computer. Once you have done this, install the node packages but running `npm i` in your terminal.
